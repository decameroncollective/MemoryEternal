# Memory Eternal
To play Memory Eternal
VR - Instructions:

The world runs on an Oculus Quest 2 tethered to a PC desktop or laptop computer from a downloadable file. The computer must have a gaming level graphics card and minimum 16 GB RAM in order to run. (It will not run on a mac.)

 

1) Download and run the Oculus software: https://oculus.com/setup

2) Download the Memory Eternal zip file and unzip it:  https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p7emz51lx9u23o5st2c0e/h?rlkey=ip4161inhjaneko2wgkpfww7e&dl=0 

3) Connect the Oculus headset to your PC via a link cable. Select “enable link” (which means that your headset can run off the PC.)

4) Double click on the unzipped "Memory_Eternal.exe" to run. You will first get a "Made in Unity" loading screen and then the world will launch. You should be able to see it both on the computer screen and also in the headset.
