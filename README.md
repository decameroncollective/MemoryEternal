# Memory Eternal
Memory Eternal | Вічна Пам'ять (2023) is a VR world designed for Oculus by the [Decameron Collective](https://www.decameroncollective.com/).  This work emerges in the wake of a global trauma, and expresses grieving at two scales – personal and collective. In the wake of crises, what do we want to remember and how? What futures should we imagine? How does care ground a wounded world?

## To play Memory Eternal VR - Instructions:

The world runs on an Oculus Quest 2 tethered to a PC desktop or laptop computer from a downloadable file. The computer must have a gaming level graphics card and minimum 16 GB RAM in order to run. (It will not run on a mac.)

1) Download and run the [Oculus software](https://oculus.com/setup)

2) Download the Memory Eternal [zip file](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p7emz51lx9u23o5st2c0e/h?rlkey=ip4161inhjaneko2wgkpfww7e&dl=0) and unzip it   

3) Connect the Oculus headset to your PC via a link cable. Select “enable link” (which means that your headset can run off the PC.)

4) Double click on the unzipped "Memory_Eternal.exe" to run. You will first get a "Made in Unity" loading screen and then the world will launch. You should be able to see it both on the computer screen and also in the headset.
