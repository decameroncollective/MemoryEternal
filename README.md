# Memory Eternal
Memory Eternal | Вічна Пам'ять (2023) is a deeply intimate work of electronic literature and research co-creation that results from years-long conversations, inquiry, and artistic experimentation between the members of the [Decameron Collective](https://www.decameroncollective.com/), designed for Oculus VR.

The generation of the world and works in it is the product of a speculative feminist praxis asking what important relationships to the past and what forms of futurity can be attained through digital storytelling and research co-creation. Here, group members experiment with interactive forms for memory work rooted in an epistemology of hope. In individually and collectively-created works, they develop a collaborative vision of how we can move through grieving to collectivity and growth. Interactants journeys in the VR world take them through experiences of mourning, sitting with, and awakening to new futures.

## To play Memory Eternal VR - Instructions:

The world runs on an Oculus Quest 2 tethered to a PC desktop or laptop computer from a downloadable file. The computer must have a gaming level graphics card and minimum 16 GB RAM in order to run. (It will not run on a mac.)

1) Download and run the [Oculus software](https://oculus.com/setup)

2) Download the Memory Eternal [zip file](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p7emz51lx9u23o5st2c0e/h?rlkey=ip4161inhjaneko2wgkpfww7e&dl=0) and unzip it   

3) Connect the Oculus headset to your PC via a link cable. Select “enable link” (which means that your headset can run off the PC.)

4) Double click on the unzipped "Memory_Eternal.exe" to run. You will first get a "Made in Unity" loading screen and then the world will launch. You should be able to see it both on the computer screen and also in the headset.
