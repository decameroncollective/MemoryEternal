# About us

The Decameron Collective is a group of nine scholars and artists and our developer who have engaged in a weekly practice of collaborating, co-creating, and curating since March of 2020. Together, we have built and exhibited two digital storyworlds, run workshops, write scholarly papers, and experiment with AI.
