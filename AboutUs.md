# About us  

The Decameron Collective is a group of nine scholars and artists and our developer who have engaged in a weekly practice of collaborating, co-creating, and curating since March of 2020. Together, we have built and exhibited two digital storyworlds, run workshops, write scholarly papers, and experiment with AI.

**Jolene Armstrong** 
* PhD University of Alberta, Comparative Literature, 2003
* BA, University of Alberta, Anthropology, 1992
Jolene is an Associate Professor of Comparative Literature and English, artist, photographer, poet, writer, translator. Her creative and translated work has recently appeared in Galaxy Brain, Peatsmoke Journal, DeLuge Literary Journal, MacroMicrocosm, Wildroof Journal, Beyond Words Literary Magazine, The Hunger Mountain Review, The Society for Misfit Stories and The Antonym. She is particularly interested in the intersection of art and literature and the potential that immersive environments present as storytelling mediums. Jolene has two academic books, Cruel Britannia: Sarah Kane’s Postmodern Traumatics (2015) and an edited collection Maria Campbell: Essays on her works (2012). Jolene is the creator and curator of the digital Museum of Ephemera (https://museumofephemera.omeka.net/) a virtual museum in which the public can contribute ephemeral items, search for information and resources on various ephemera. In her spare time, she assembles in images and words the shimmering, sometimes terrifying, ephemeral beauty that marks our collective existence on this blue planet. She lives and works in Amiskwaciy-Wâskahikan, treaty 6 territory (Edmonton) with her two kids and a menagerie of weird pets and projects strewn about her house.

**Kelly Egan**
Kelly Egan is an Associate Professor in Cultural Studies at Trent University. Her filmwork explores issues of materiality, intermediality, and embodiment. Her research centers on dead media, not just those that endure, because they can illustrate an alternative history outside of dominant narratives, and allow us to reimagine new relationships between technology and artistic practices. She approaches both creative and critical work as a media archaeologist, combining critical histories and material analyses by considering the story of a medium outside of its hierarchal, canonical and linear history. Her dissertation “The Projector’s Noises: A Media Archaeology of Cinema Through the Film Projector” (2013) explores how twentieth century artists critically engaged with the film projector’s noises at moments of technological transition, and how this engagement challenges the dominant structures of the cinematic apparatus by drawing attention to the liveness and performativity of the cinematic event.
With over a hundred national and international exhibitions, her award-winning experimental films have screened widely at major festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival, the Images Festival, the New York International Film Festival, the Edinburgh International Film Festival, the Rotterdam International Film Festival, WNDX, the Chicago Underground Film Festival and EXiS Experimental Film and Video Festival. Her film-quilts have been exhibited at the York Quays Gallery/Harbourfront Centre (Toronto), Evans Contemporary (Peterborough), Setzkasten Wein (Vienna), and L’espace virtuel (Chicoutimi).
In addition to Trent University, Kelly has taught at Toronto Metropolitan University, Millennium Film in NYC, the Liaison of Independent Filmmakers of Toronto (LIFT), and the Independent Filmmakers Cooperative of Ottawa (IFCO). She has also served on the Board of Directors of the Art Gallery of Peterborough, LIFT, Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre (CFMDC), and on the selection committees for the Images Festival in Toronto. She is a founding member of Canadian Images in Conversation (CIIC) and continues to develop new programs with CIIC (Peterborough), Loop Collective (Toronto) and Lost Dominion Screening Collective (Ottawa).

**Hendrick de Haan**
Hendrick W. de Haan is a multimedia artist in the Toronto region of Canada. He has led several initiatives including independent music projects, creation of music videos, and building interactive 3D worlds for screens and VR. Hendrick has been a contributing artist to a diverse range of collaborative projects for which he has produced audio and visual pieces, authored computer programs for custom visual and audio effects, and led the design and construction of 3D worlds and implemented the interactive mechanics in these worlds. He is collaborating with members of the Decameron Collective on works such as the interactive WebGL piece "Decameron 2.0" and the immersive VR piece "Memory Eternal". 
Hendrick's work has been exhibited at national and international exhibitions including the Electronic Literature Organization (ELO) media arts festival, the Toronto International Short Film Festival, the International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling (ICIDS), and the Festival of International Virtual & Augmented Reality Stories (FIVARS). The VR piece “Slava Ukraini”, a collaboration with Dr. Jolene Armstrong, was invited to and exhibited at the 2025 Tokyo Short Film Festival and the film “Aquaphoria”, a collaboration with Dr. Monique Tschofen, won the award for Best Environmental Film at the 2025 Montreal Women Film Festival and at the Toronto Festival of CIFT.
Hendrick is also a science professor at Ontario Tech University specializing in computational physics. His research centers on simulating and digitally visualizing biological molecules at the nanoscale. He has made VR worlds featuring original research results such as simulations of DNA moving in nano-confinement and bacteria moving across a surface. They also contain educational elements such as giant proteins and visualization of stochastic motion that give insight into protein structure-function and how random motion is related to entropy. These worlds have been used at multiple outreach events and also as the venue for in-VR lectures.

##Siobhan O'Flynn##
Siobhan O’Flynn is an Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream, Canadian Studies Program, University of Toronto. Over two decades of academic and professional consulting inform her research/creation in digital storytelling with expertise in interactive, participatory, transmedia, augmented reality and virtual reality projects via her company NarrativeNow, and her ongoing examination of the precarity of data privacy in the context of online activities, social, and entertainment. Her current interactive works explore the expressive and unruly potential of AI image and text generators for elegy, memory, and recursive storytelling. Her current monograph in progress, Mapping Digital Narrativity: Design, Practice, Theory, will be published by Routledge Press, date TBD. She is a member of the Decameron Collective, investigating digital collaboration during the Covid+ pandemic.
